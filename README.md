# Album Manager - my semester project for COMP6272
This is my semester project for COMP6272 at University of Memphis, Fall 2023

This is a simple database manager, meant to store info on my vinyl album collection. It's written in BASH script with a handful of functions in the "album_mgr.sh" file. 

Note that "album_mgr.sh" is the standalone DB manager and will function without the other files. Any other "*.sh" files are test functions as I go and will be incorporated in the album manager once tested. *.db files store the data for the database and can be used as seeds if you want to test functionality. Feel free to download and only the album_mgr.sh file, it will prompt you to create any data needed and run you through the process so as to handle formatting for the records used in the database.

Enjoy!
